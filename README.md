# AI for Cardiovascular Risk Prediction
**Team:** CODESTORM  
**Members:** Divya Sindhu, Jiya Thakker  

## 📌 Project Summary
This project is an AI-powered early-warning system that predicts cardiovascular risk (Low, Medium, High) using simple health inputs such as BP, cholesterol, glucose, BMI, and lifestyle data.  
The model uses **XGBoost** for prediction and **SHAP** for explainability.

## 🚀 Features
- Predicts personalized cardiovascular risk  
- Uses routine health and lifestyle data  
- XGBoost model for high accuracy  
- SHAP values for transparent explanations  
- Suitable for hospitals, clinics, and screening camps  

## 🧠 Model Workflow
1. Data preprocessing  
2. Model training (Logistic Regression → Random Forest → XGBoost)  
3. Evaluation using ROC-AUC  
4. Explainability using SHAP  

## 📊 Results
- **ROC-AUC:** 0.92 (XGBoost)  
- **Top risk factors:** Systolic BP, LDL cholesterol, glucose, smoking  
- SHAP analysis shows how each feature impacts risk  

## 📁 Repository Contents
- `AI_Cardiovascular_Improved_FINAL.pptx` — Main hackathon presentation  
- `Flowchart_Slide_v2.pptx` — Flowchart slide  
- `README.md` — Project documentation  
- (Optional) `assets/` — images, diagrams, etc.  

## 🎥 Demo
This repository contains the PPT used for the hackathon submission.  
A live demo (Streamlit/Colab) can be added in future updates.

## 🧰 Tech Stack
- Python  
- Pandas, NumPy  
- Scikit-learn  
- XGBoost  
- SHAP  
- Streamlit (optional UI)

## 🧑‍⚕️ Problem This Solves
Doctors often miss early signs of cardiovascular risk due to limited tools and time.  
Our AI system identifies hidden patterns and provides early warnings — preventing heart attacks and saving lives.
